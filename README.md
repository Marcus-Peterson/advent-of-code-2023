# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

## About This Repository

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 solutions repository! Advent of Code is an exciting annual event featuring a series of Christmas-themed programming challenges. These challenges cover a wide array of topics in computer science and programming, offering an excellent opportunity to hone problem-solving skills.

As a software developer specializing in Embedded Systems & IoT, I tackle these puzzles with a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise. This repository documents my journey through the event, showcasing my solutions and coding approach.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is organized in a separate folder following this format:

- `day_1`, `day_2`, `day_3`, ..., `day_25`
  - Within each folder, you'll find a Python file named `day_1.py`, `day_2.py`, etc., containing my solution for the respective day.

## How to Use

To run the solutions, ensure that Python is installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]

2. ```bash 
    cd day_X

3. ```bash
    python day_X.py
